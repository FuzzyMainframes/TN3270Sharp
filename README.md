# TN3270Sharp
 a .net library to write applications/servers with C# that use TN3270 clients

## Inspiration
This library was heavily inspired by [racingmars/go3270](https://github.com/racingmars/go3270) which has a similar goal, except it is designed to use golang instead of C#.  After watching a demo video of go3270, I decided that I needed to have the same functionality for my favorite developer ecosystem.
